# Checkpoint: Improve Dashboard Usage Page UX

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Task**: #2 - Improve dashboard usage page UX
**Agent**: frontend-dev

## Changes Made

### 1. Date range label in chart titles
- Added `dateRangeLabel` computed property to `usagePage()` that maps `selectedDays` to human-readable labels ("Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "Last 90 days", "All time").
- Chart titles now dynamically include the selected range, e.g. "Token Usage by Day (Last 30 days)" and "Cost by Model (Last 30 days)".

### 2. Loading skeleton while data loads
- Added skeleton placeholder that renders 4 stat-card skeletons and 2 chart-area skeletons while `loading` is true.
- Cost summary cards are hidden during loading (`x-show="costEstimate && !loading"`).
- Charts section uses `x-show="!loading"` to avoid showing empty canvases during fetch.
- Added CSS classes: `.skeleton`, `.skeleton-text`, `.skeleton-heading` with a shimmer animation in `dashboard/css/app.css`.

### 3. Empty state for charts
- Added inline empty-state messages inside each chart card when there's no data for the selected period (e.g., "No token data for this period.").

## Files Modified
- `dashboard/index.html` (lines ~750-830 HTML template, lines ~1560-1570 JS `dateRangeLabel` getter)
- `dashboard/css/app.css` (skeleton loading CSS section)

## Tests
- All 87 tests pass.
