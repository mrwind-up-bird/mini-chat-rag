# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-10

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Add an embed snippet modal with tabbed integration methods to bot profile cards in the MiniRAG dashboard.
* **Current Status:** Feature complete and deployed to production (mini-rag.de). Two commits pushed and deployed.

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Added "Embed" button to bot card actions in `dashboard/index.html` (line ~202, between "Try It" and "Delete")
* Created embed snippet modal with three tabs: Script Tag, Custom Element, Styling
* Added `embedBot`, `embedTab`, `embedTabs` state to `botsPage()` function
* Added `showEmbed(bot)`, `getEmbedSnippet(tab)`, `copySnippet()` methods to `botsPage()`
* Snippet auto-fills `window.location.origin` for API URL and widget script src, bot ID, and bot name
* "Copy Snippet" button copies the active tab's snippet to clipboard with toast feedback
* Help text links to API Tokens page for token creation
* Updated `docs/widget-integration.md` Dashboard Integration section to document the Embed button
* Commit `8dbfd61`: initial embed button + modal
* Commit `d35d782`: tabbed integration methods (Script Tag, Custom Element, Styling)
* Both commits deployed via GitHub Actions → VPS SSH (`Deploy to VPS` workflow)

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* No major issues encountered.
* Minor: `python` not on PATH in this env, must use `.venv/bin/python` for pytest.

## 4. Active Variable State
* All 77 tests passing (SQLite in-memory, no Docker needed)
* Docker services running: postgres:5432, qdrant:6333, redis:6379
* Production deployed at mini-rag.de
* Branch: `main`, up to date with `origin/main`

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Manual QA: open dashboard on mini-rag.de, click Embed on a bot card, verify all three tabs render correctly
2. [ ] Test clipboard copy works across browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. [ ] Consider adding a "dark/light" preview toggle to the Styling tab so users can see theme changes live
