# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-06

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Add multi-URL source creation to the MiniRAG dashboard so users can paste multiple URLs at once
* **Current Status:** Feature complete and pushed to `origin/main` (commit `512f00e`)

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Changed URL input from single `<input>` to `<textarea>` in `dashboard/index.html` (line ~383)
* Added `createUrlSources()` method in `dashboard/index.html` (line ~974) that:
  - Splits textarea by commas and newlines
  - Auto-generates source name from `hostname + pathname` if user leaves name blank
  - Appends URL info to user-provided name when multiple URLs
  - Creates each Source via `API.createSource()` sequentially
  - Triggers ingestion via `API.triggerIngest()` for each created source
  - Shows succeeded/failed toast (same pattern as multi-file upload)
* Updated `createSource()` to dispatch URL type to the new method
* Removed dead `url` branch from original `createSource()` text path
* All 65 tests pass, no backend changes needed
* Committed and pushed as `512f00e` on `main`

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* No major issues encountered
* The implementation was purely frontend — no API changes required since each URL becomes its own Source record via the existing `POST /v1/sources` endpoint

## 4. Active Variable State
* Docker services running: postgres:5432, qdrant:6333, redis:6379
* Python venv at `.venv/`
* 65 tests passing
* Untracked files in `drafts/` (blog letters from previous sessions — not committed)

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Test multi-URL creation manually in the browser dashboard
2. [ ] Consider adding URL validation (basic format check) before submission
3. [ ] Consider adding a progress indicator for multi-URL creation (e.g., "Creating 3/5...")
